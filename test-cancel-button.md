# Cancel Button Fix Summary

## Changes Made:

1. **Added detailed logging to TasksController.php**:
   - Added logging to `cancel_task()` method to track when cancel is requested
   - Added logging to `cancel_batch_task()` to track batch cancellations
   - Added logging to `cancel_generation_task()` to track generation cancellations

2. **Fixed JavaScript error handling in tasks.ts**:
   - Updated error parsing to handle both `result.data` and `result.data.message` formats
   - Rebuilt JavaScript assets with `npm run build`

3. **Improved task status updates**:
   - Updated batch statuses in parent data when cancelling
   - Added TaskIndexService update to refresh the cached task index
   - Ensured transient data is properly saved after cancellation

## Testing Steps:

1. Go to the Tasks page in WordPress admin
2. Find a task with "Pending" status
3. Click the "Cancel" button
4. Confirm the cancellation in the dialog
5. Check that:
   - The status changes to "Cancelled" immediately in the UI
   - A success message appears
   - The action buttons are replaced with "â€”"
   - After refresh, the task still shows as "Cancelled"
   - Check the log file for the cancellation entries

## Log Entries to Look For:

```
[TasksController::cancel_task] Cancel task requested for ID: {task_id} by user {user_id}
[TasksController::cancel_generation_task] Attempting to cancel generation: {task_id}
[TasksController::cancel_generation_task] Generation {task_id} status updated to cancelled
[TasksController::cancel_generation_task] Cancelling {n} batches for generation {task_id}
[TasksController::cancel_batch_task] Batch {batch_id} cancelled
[TasksController::cancel_generation_task] Updated task index for generation {task_id}
[TasksController::cancel_generation_task] Generation {task_id} successfully cancelled
```

## Potential Issues Fixed:

1. Missing error message parsing in JavaScript
2. Task index not being updated after cancellation
3. Batch statuses not properly updated in parent task data
4. Lack of logging made debugging difficult
