# Translation Guide

Guidelines for translating Nuclear Engagement into other languages.

This plugin ships with a translation template located at `nuclear-engagement/languages/nuclear-engagement.pot`.
Follow the steps below to create or update `.po` and `.mo` files for your locale.

## Creating a New Translation

1. Open the POT file in Poedit (or any gettext editor).
2. Choose **Create new translation** and select your language.
3. Translate the strings and save the file as `nuclear-engagement-<locale>.po`.
4. Poedit will automatically compile the corresponding `nuclear-engagement-<locale>.mo` file.
5. Copy both files to the plugin's `languages/` directory.

WordPress will load translations from this folder when the site language matches the locale code.

## Updating the POT File

After adding new translatable strings in the plugin code, regenerate the template using WPâ€‘CLI. Run the command from the repository root so all plugin files are scanned:

```bash
wp i18n make-pot nuclear-engagement nuclear-engagement/languages/nuclear-engagement.pot
```

You can also use the helper script defined in `package.json`:

```bash
npm run i18n
```

Then refresh your `.po` files in Poedit ("Update from POT") and recompile the `.mo` files.
