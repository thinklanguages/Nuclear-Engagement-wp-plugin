Nuclear Engagement is the easiest way to **turn all your blog posts into interactive quizzes, summaries and table of contents** ‚Äì automatically, in one run.

In just one click, our AI analyzes your article and generates a concise summary and a short quiz to **engage** your readers.

If you want visitors to stay longer and interact with your content, Nuclear Engagement is your plug-and-play solution.
It's called Nuclear Engagement because it is the nuclear option to boost blog engagement.

With NE, you can **bulk generate engaging content like quizzes and summaries from your blog posts using AI**. The generated content is stored in post meta fields, which you can display via shortcodes or automatic insertion.

üöÄ **3√ó Longer Visits** with instant AI quizzes & summaries
‚öôÔ∏è **1‚ÄëClick, Sitewide**: Bulk process 100+ posts in seconds
üîí **No Coding Needed**: Auto‚Äëinsert via shortcode or auto‚Äëappend
üìà **Lead Capture**: Built‚Äëin email opt‚Äëin via Zapier & Make

#### Why Nuclear Engagement
What sets it apart from other quiz plugins and summarizers is the option to **process every post in one run**. As a result, you get a sitewide content upgrade in a matter of seconds. No manual writing, editing, settings, or placement is needed. The process is **fully automated**.
This makes NE especially appealing to **large blogs** (100+ posts).

In short, NE is the only solution to:
- **Generate** AI summaries and quizzes from blog post content
- **Fully automate** the process from input, through creation and storage, all the way to display
- **Process** posts in **batches** (not one by one)
When I say "the only solution", I mean it. This plugin is created from my own custom code that I had to write because I couldn't find any plugin or tool that does that.

#### Automated Process
**Creation** => **Storage** => **Display**

üòÖ *Other plugins and tools*
üë®‚Äçüíª/ü§ñ => üë®‚Äçüíª => üë®‚Äçüíª (hours)
ü§Ø *Nuclear Engagement*
ü§ñ => ü§ñ => ü§ñ (seconds)

‚úîÔ∏è If you have a blog post, you're already **one click** away from a summary and a quiz. Only with NE!

#### Processing at Scale
üòÖ *Other plugins and tools*
1üî¥ => 1üìù (one by one)
ü§Ø *Nuclear Engagement*
1üî¥ => ‚ôæÔ∏èüìùüìùüìùüìùüìùüìùüìùüìùüìùüìù (all posts)

‚úîÔ∏è You can literally **upgrade your entire blog in a few seconds** - whether it has 100 or 10,000 posts. No other solution is capable of that.

Turn every WordPress blog post into an **interactive experience** with AI-generated quizzes, summaries and table of contents that keep readers engaged 3x longer ‚Äì with just one click.
